**Dashboard** allows you to build Jina Flows using a graphical interface. Drag and drop your pods quickly; no code required! Run Flows and monitor by exploring detailed Logs!

Jina Dashboard is a low-code monitoring and management environment for Jina. With the Dashboard, you can build Jina Flows and manage them from a central location. Get detailed insights into the health of the Flow with the use of log stream analysis!

To use the Jina hosted version of the Dashboard visit [the Jina website](https://dashboard.jina.ai/)

# Getting started
## 1. Start Jina Daemon

In order to use the dashboard you will need to start a Jina Deamon. You can do this by either using a Docker container that has been pre packaged for you or manually using a Command Line Interface (CLI).

### Using Jina Daemon with Docker (Reccommended)

- Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and run Docker Desktop
- Pull the Docker image with
 ```bash
docker pull jinaai/jina:master-daemon
```
- Run the Docker image with
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 5555:5555 jinaai/jina:master-daemon
```
<p align="center">
<img src=".github/.README_images/jinaD_run_docker.png?raw=true" alt="log server settings" width="70%">
</p>

### Using Jina Daemon with Command Line Interface (Not reccomended)

- Install [JinaD](../remote/jinad.md)
- Run JinaD with
```bash
jinad
```

<p align="center">
<img src=".github/.README_images/jinaD_run_cli.png?raw=true" alt="log server settings" width="70%">
</p>


## 2. Connect the Dashboard to Jina Daemon

- Go to [Settings](https://dashboard.jina.ai/#/settings)
- Set **host** to: `http://localhost`
- Set **port** to: the port specified when running JinaD (8000 in this example)
- Save changes
- Click 'Refresh' in the bottom right corner

<p align="center">
<img src=".github/.README_images/refresh.png?raw=true" alt="log server settings" width="40%">
</p>

  - The globe icon in the top right corner will indicate connection status. A red X means the Dashboard is not connected to any Jina instance; a green checkmark indicates an active connection. The icon should change to green to show Dashboard, and the Jina Deamon are now connected.

<p align="center">
<img src=".github/.README_images/2859cc17.png?raw=true" alt="log server settings" width="80%">
</p>

 - You should now be able to see the log stream and flow visualization.

# Self-hosted Dashboard
You can also use a self-hosted dashboard instance locally.

Note: features like the Hub will not work when running the Dashboard locally. They are restricted to the `dashboard.jina.ai` origin. They are not necessary to view logs or interact with flows. If you would like to browse the Hub, do so from [dashboard.jina.ai](https://dashboard.jina.ai/).

## Set up
- Clone the GitHub repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jina-ai/dashboard.git && cd dashboard
```
- Install dependencies using command
```bash
npm i
```
## Run dashboard

### Run in debug mode

- Start the testServer
```bash
npm run start_dev-server
```
- testServer should now be running on `http://localhost:5000` by default

- Start the dashboard
```bash
npm run start-dashboard
```

- Dashboard should now be served on `http://localhost:3000` by default

### Run in the live mode

- Build dashboard:
```bash
npm run build-dashboard
```
- Run dashboard:
```bash
node dashboard
```
- Dashboard should now be served on `http://localhost:3030` by default
